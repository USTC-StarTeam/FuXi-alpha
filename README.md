# FuXi-$\alpha$

This is the  Pytorch implementation for our paper `FuXi-ùõº: Scaling Recommendation Model with Feature Interaction Enhanced Transformer`

## Getting started

### Public experiments

To replicate the public experiments conducted in the traditional sequential recommender setting on MovieLens as described in the paper, please follow these steps:

#### Install dependencies.

Install PyTorch based on official instructions. Then,

```
pip3 install gin-config absl-py scikit-learn scipy matplotlib numpy apex hypothesis pandas fbgemm_gpu iopath
```

#### Download and preprocess data.

```
mkdir -p tmp/ && python3 preprocess_public_data.py
```

#### Run model training.

A GPU with 24GB or more HBM should work for most datasets.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 main.py --gin_config_file=configs/ml-1m/fuxi-sampled-softmax-n128-final.gin --master_port=12345
```

Other configurations are included in configs/ml-1m, configs/ml-20m to make reproducing these experiments easier.

#### Verify results.

By default we write experimental logs to exps/. We can launch tensorboard with something like the following:

```
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-1m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-20m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
```
